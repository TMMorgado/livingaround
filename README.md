# 🏡 Accommodation Website

This is a simple, responsive website I’m building to showcase accommodation options, nearby places, and contact info. It’s still a work in progress, but the main structure is already in place.

## 🔍 What's inside

- **Home page** (`index.html`) — the main landing page.
- **Accommodation** (`accommodation.html`) — details about the place.
- **Places** (`locais.html`) — some suggestions of cool spots to check out.
- **Contact** (`contactos.html`) — a form and general contact info.
